# Phish4All
A service to help you and your family stay safe against fraud.

## How It Works
### Monthly Phishing Simulations
Each beneficiary receives realistic phishing emails and SMS messages every month—crafted to educate without causing harm. These simulations cover various fraud techniques to build awareness and digital reflexes.

### Track Campaign Results
As account manager, you gain full visibility into campaign performance. Monitor key metrics for each beneficiary including email opens, link clicks, and form submissions to identify areas for improvement. 

### Protect Your Loved Ones
Strengthen your family's security by identifying who is most vulnerable to phishing attacks. Use the interaction data to provide targeted education and build digital literacy for everyone you care about.
